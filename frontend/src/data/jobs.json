While working at DHEWD you will be... helping to develop the workforce of the future! Join us as we pursue our vision of \"Every Missourian empowered with the skills and education needed for success.\"\r\n\r\nFocus of the Position: This position works within Missouri's Current Employment Statistics (CES) program, which is administered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CES unit is housed in the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC), which is the state cooperative partner to BLS and the labor market information agency responsible for measuring labor market activity and the economy in Missouri. CES works with employment estimates, average weekly and hourly earnings, and average hours worked in nonagricultural industries, based on payroll records for non-supervisory workers. The data is used by federal and state government as indicators of economic health and by businesses for site location planning and labor contract escalations. The position will be responsible for monthly estimate reviews, annual benchmarking, as well as providing support to other BLS programs. Candidates interested in this position should be flexible and able to adjust as the demand and focus on work requirements shift based on program need.\r\n\r\nWhat you'll do:\r\n\r\nTo perform this job successfully, an individual must be able to perform each essential function of the job with or without reasonable accommodation.\r\nâ€¢ Keep abreast of employment and economic conditions in the state.\r\nâ€¢ Review CES preliminary and final estimates monthly.\r\nâ€¢ Transfer data via secure networks to BLS and other partners as required.\r\nâ€¢ Participate in annual benchmarking as well as preparing the non-covered employees calculations.\r\nâ€¢ Coding missing employer information.\r\nâ€¢ Other duties related to BLS programs as assigned.\r\nâ€¢ Perform other related work as assigned.\r\nâ€¢ Demonstrate regular and reliable attendance.\r\n\r\nMinimum Qualifications\r\nâ€¢ A Bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university including or supplemented by three earned credit hours in statistics or research methods.\r\nâ€¢ Technical and/or professional experience in a related field may substitute on a year-for-year basis for deficiencies in the required college education.\r\n\r\nMore reasons to love this position:\r\n\r\nThe State of Missouri offers an excellent benefits package that includes a defined pension plan, generous amounts of leave and holiday time, and eligibility for health insurance coverage. Your total compensation is more than the dollars you receive in your paycheck. To help demonstrate the value of working for the State of Missouri, we have created an interactive Total Compensation Calculator. This tool provides a comprehensive view of benefits and more that are offered to prospective employees. The Total Compensation Calculator and other applicant resources can be found .\r\n\r\nThe State of Missouri is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees",
